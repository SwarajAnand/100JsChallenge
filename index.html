                <p>100 Days - 100 Projects it's a challenge I'm going to take (and you can join too) starting today
                    (1th March 2024) that it's meant to improve my programming skills by building projects (lots of
                    them emoji-smiley). <br>
                    <br>
                    Think of it as the next step if you ever participated in the <b>#100DaysOfCode</b> challenge.
                    <br><br>
                    <b>Note: </b> <i>Scroll down to see the projects I've built so far. </i> <br><br>
                    <b>Note #2: </b> <i>at the end of the post you can also find 3 variants of this challenge if you
                        feel like changing it a little bit. üòÑ</i>

                <h1>Rules for me</h1>
                <p>I've created some rules for myself that I don't want to enforce on anyone, but feel free to do the
                    same if you want!</p>
